			<p>I am a Chicago native, born and raised. My mother, who was born in Mississippi and raised in Chicago, brought in the old school work ethic (“idle hands are the devil’s workshop”) into my upbringing. Self- proclaimed ‘Jane of all trades’, I make sure that I put my all in everything that I do, both professionally and personally. Besides being a Cyber Security student in Year Up, I am the LC Service Coordinator, sending emails and meeting requests although out the program. If I’m not running around the building networking with staff and corporate partners, I am often found riding a Divvy around town or attempting to run with Jack, the coolest Executive Director I know (no seriously, talk to him. I’m not brown noising at all). </p>
<p>Outside of Year Up, my interests includes anime (if you must ask: One Punch Man, Attack on Titan, Sailor Moon, Nana, and all of Howl’s Moving Castle are my favorites), playing Smite or League of Legends on my downtime, watch TV, and yardwork. My favorite classes that I play for MOBAs are hunters and mages. For Smite, I love to play Scylla, Ra, Apollo and Mercury. Mercury is an odd case since he’s an Assassin class character and I prefer characters from a distance. For League of Legends, I love playing the starting character Ashe (champion level 4), Twitch, Lux and Caitlyn. 
 Five years from now, I imagine working as an IT Security analyst in a software development company. Although my dream company is Hi-Rez Studios (the company behind Smite), I can find myself working in any company with my growing knowledge of networking and security skills, my love of working in a team, and my adaptability to any environment. That is pretty much me in a nutshell. </p> </div>

					<h3>Business Etiquette</h3>
					It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key.
