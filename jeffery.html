			<p>I was born and raised on the south side of Chicago. I spent the majority of my earlier education in the Chicago Public School (CPS) system. I attended and graduated from Thornwood High School in 2011. It was at Thornwood High School where I took up an interest in accounting and finance after being exposed to those areas for my required elective courses. I have always found subjects and courses related to math interesting, and with accounting there is multiple layers of math I am required to know and use, which I love.</p> 
<p>I enlisted in the United States Air Force after graduating from high school. At the time I felt like I had no other options so I went into the military thinking that would be the best fit for me. When I came back home I got introduced to a non-profit program helping young adults with work ready and IT skills called Jobs for Youth. At Jobs for Youth, I was first introduced to Year Up. I remembering applying and not having very good interview skills at the time, and that’s why I believe I wasn’t selected at that time. I enrolled into college shortly after. I attended Harold Washington College, which is one of the seven schools associated with City Colleges of Chicago. At Harold Washington College I was a very active student. I was apart of Phi Theta Kappa International Honor's Society, and became an officer for my chapter, the Mu  Pi Chapter, as their Officer for Membership. I also acquired work experience being a Work Study student, before earning a part time position as a College Library Assistant Part I.</p> 
<p>Currently I am a student intern at Year Up Chicago, where I am apart of class 12, and I am more than half way done with the completion of learning development, which consists of classes in hardware, software, web development, and career development and interpersonal relations. My specific area of concentration is software, and I have been exposed to new applications I haven't worked with before such as Microsoft access, and project, working with data base systems. What's next for me would be taking the skills I am learning during L&D and applying it to the internship I will be placed at. I have one lead on a potential internship seat which is with JP Morgan Chase and I am excited about that opportunity and the many possibilities where I can combine my interests in accounting and finance in a customer service role, all thanks to Year Up Chicago.</p>

					<h3>Business Etiquette</h3>
					It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key.
