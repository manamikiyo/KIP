					<h3>Business Etiquette</h3>
					It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key.
