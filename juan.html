	<p>My high school years were nothing of what I expected. I thought that during high school that I wanted to be involved with computers. I was obviously wrong. Coming into my sophomore year there were these new technical education classes that were going to be catering to 4 areas, IT, Nursing, Web Design, and Culinary arts. Thinking that a career in IT is what I wanted to do I applied for the IT technical classes. To my surprising the classes were filled and the only other option there was left was culinary. I hated the first couple of weeks of my culinary class because that wasn’t something that I wanted to do. 
My love for culinary came from a mistake. After a couple of more weeks into this class I learned to love culinary because just like IT, I was working with my hands to solve different puzzles of a meal. Something that I liked to do, and still is something that I like to do.

					<h3>Business Etiquette</h3>
					It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I’m never giving up, I’m just getting started. The key to more success is to have a lot of pillows. To succeed you must believe. When you believe, you will succeed. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key.
